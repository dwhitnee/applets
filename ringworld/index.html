Ever wonder what it would be like to live in a Ring World?
<p>
A circular man-made structure out in space where there is no gravity except 
the centrifugal force generated by the structure spinning?
To people standing on the "floor" of the ring, it is hard to tell the difference
from being on Earth, but there are important differences.

On Earth, gravity pulls us down and keeps us on the ground.   <br>
On a RingWorld there is no gravity, centrifugal force keeps the residents on the ground. <br>
On the Earth a ball dropped from a height goes straight down, but what is 
"straight down" in space?  
<br>
It may not be what you think!

Jump into a
<a href = ringworld.html>virtual RingWorld</a> and see for yourself.<br>
<font size=-1>[50K Java applet, 4.x browser required]</font><br>
You start with a rotating settlement with six story buildings.  You can place balls on 
platforms at any height and make them fall to the ground.
Try moving the balls and throwing them, too.  

<p>
If you have problems running the applet see the <a href = "#java">
Notes</a> section.

<h3>Notes on running the Java Applet:</h3>
A recent (4.x) web browser is required, or you can download the applet and run it locally.<p>

<b>PC and Unix</b>:
<br>
Most 4.x browsers should do.
Netscape 4.06 or better is probably required.  I have not verified
precisely which version Netscape and Microsoft got their act together.
I know early Netscape 4.0 browsers will not work.

<p>
<b>Mac</b>:
<br>
This applet requires a browser that uses the native 
<a href= http://www.apple.com/java/>Apple Java</a>.
Currently three browsers use Apple's JVM:<br>
<ul>
<li><a href= http://www.apple.com/java/>Apple Applet Runner</a> (part of MRJ)
<li><a href=http://www.icab.de/>iCab</a>
<li><a href=http://www.microsoft.com/mac/ie>Internet Explorer 4.x</a>
<li>Sorry, Netscape does not yet support Java 1.1 on the Mac.
</ul>
MacOS 8.5 and later come with Java built in, or you can download the
<a href= http://www.apple.com/java/>Macintosh Runtime for Java
 (MRJ)</a> separately.<br>
<P>

<b>Download</b><br>
You can download this applet and run it directly on your machine if you have Java installed.
<ul>
<li>Option-click (Mac) or Right-click (PC) to download the web page 
<a href = ringworld.html>ringworld.html</a>
and the applet code
<a href=RingWorld.jar>RingWorld.jar</a>.<br>
<li>Place both files in a folder anywhere on your hard drive  
<li> Run "Applet Runner" (AppletViewer) on the ringworld.html file.<br>  
If you don't have appletviewer or Applet Runner you will need to download it 
(<a href = http://www.apple.com/java/>MacOS MRJ</a>, 
<a href ="http://www.javasoft.com/products/jdk/1.1/jre/download-jre-windows.html" >Windows</a>).
</ul>
