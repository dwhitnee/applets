<h3>
<a NAME="About"></a>About RingWorld</h3>
This is a simulation of a rotating space settlement without gravity. The
only forces influencing the objects in it are the rotation of the ring.
The black squares are buildings up to six storys tall (20m on each side.)
The balls are weather ballons(?) They're artificially large so they can
be grabbed.
<blockquote>r = radius of the RingWorld (meters)
<br>g = apparent gravity at the surface of the ring
<br>v = velocity of ring at the surface (meters/second)
<br>t = period of rotation (seconds)
<br>&nbsp;</blockquote>

<h3>
<a NAME="Use"></a>How to Use</h3>

<ul>
<li>
Press <b>Jump</b> to have the balls fall off of their platforms.</li>

<li>
With <b>Lock Viewpoint</b> you can view the simulation from afar, watching
the ring rotate freely. Or you can attach (lock) yourself to the ring so
the rotation appears to stop.</li>

<li>
Buttons with letters in brackets <b>[p]</b> have keyboard short cuts. For
example,you can pause the simulation by typing 'p' (or spacebar, too).
If it does not appear to work, click inside the ring and try again.</li>

<li>
To add balls to the simulation, double-click anywhere inside the ring,
or press the <b>Random</b> button to have a ball placed randomly. New balls
will appear with a line under them. This is a stationary platform that
rotates with the ring.</li>

<li>
<b>Show Velocity Vectors</b> will draw arrows indicating the direction
the balls would travel if left alone.&nbsp; Shift-Click and drag a ball
to change its velocity.&nbsp; Press the Shift key and hold the mouse button
down over a ball and it will turn red.&nbsp; Move the mouse in the direction
you want the ball to travel, and a line will appear indicating the velocity
vector you are adding to the ball's current velocity.</li>

<li>
Click on<b> Edit World</b> to see the dimensions of the world. Change the
radius and the apparent gravity and see what happens.</li>

<li>
If there's just too much stuff in the world, you can always start over
with <b>Reset</b>.</li>

<li>
Speed and <b>zoom</b>ing are controled with the four buttons on the top
right. The speed multiplier is shown in the upper left. For example, '2x'
means that time is passing twice as fast as in real time.</li>

<li>
Turn on <b>Real Time</b> to see how fast this world would really operate.&nbsp;
A best attempt is made at having things move at the rate they would in
the real world.&nbsp; As such, you cannot speed up, slow down, or pause
the world.&nbsp; You can still pause the display, but the world will continue
and when you un-pause, the world will jump forward to where it would be
if you had not paused it in the first place.</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<a NAME="Experiments"></a>Things to Try</h3>

<ul>
<li>
Turn on Velocity Vectors and drag a ball around.&nbsp; Notice how its velocity
changes.</li>

<li>
Turn on Trails and unlock the viewpoint.&nbsp; Notice how the trail curves,
but the ball continues in a straight line.</li>

<li>
Lock the viewpoint and zoom in to grab a ball.&nbsp; Shift click to toss
the ball in the air.&nbsp; See if you can get the ball to land in the same
place it started.&nbsp; Pausing the simulation can help in setting the
velocity vector of the ball (or multiple balls at once).</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<a NAME="Bugs"></a>Bugs and Enhancements</h3>
This applet requires Java 1.1, and most 4.x browsers do only a fair job
of running applets.&nbsp; Therefore this applet will probably behave differently
on different systems.&nbsp; I've made my best attempt at getting this to
run on various systems, but there will always be some differences.&nbsp;
If you have problems, find bugs, or have suggestions, please send email
to <a href="mailto:dwhitney@cs.stanford.edu">dwhitney@cs.stanford.edu</a>.
<br>Please include what machine, browser, and version of Java you are running
on.
<h3>
<a NAME="Source"></a>Source code</h3>
You are welcome to use the Java source code in any non-commercial manner
you see fit.&nbsp; Hopefully it is well written and documented enough so
that you can learn something from it.&nbsp; Source code (JDK 1.1) is <a href="src/">here</a>.
<p>This software is supplied AS-IS.&nbsp; No warranty is given or implied.
