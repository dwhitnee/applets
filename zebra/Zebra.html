This is an applet that will solve logic problems.  The GUI is a little
shaky at present, sue me I wrote it in a week.
<P>
I wrote this for MacTech's Programmer's Challenge, and in blatant
violation of the rules I wrote it in Java.  It's slow, oh well.  I
believe it is correct however.  If you have a set of clues that breaks
it, please let me know and I'll try and fix it.
<P>
To enter clues, you can paste them into the clue window and click
"Enter Clues".  It doesn't handle bad clues too gracefully yet.  Make
sure and check the console window for errors it spits up.  (e.g. all
relations must be defined before they are used or else it chokes.)
<P>
Clicking "Next" will step you through the logic the machine is going
through.  Clicking "Solve" will tell it to go right to a solution.
<P>
I've tested it with the Challenge sample input and with Ernst Munter's Lewis
Carrol clues.  It seems to work for both of them.
